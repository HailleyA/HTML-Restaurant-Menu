            My parents house always smelled of delicious cuisines from back home. My vision was to have my H-Thai-ML restaurant smell that exact way. When you enter the dining area, you are immediately smacked in the face with the aroma of mouthwatering food waiting to be consumed!

Our first restaurant was opened in the beautiful city of Los Angeles, where it all began. After my parents moved here from Thailand, it was always their dream to share the foods they brought from home with all of whom they met. But unfortunately, they never achieved their dream of opening a restaurant. I, being their first-born, made it my mission to show my parents that it was possible to have a family-owned restaurant in a new city. Thus, H-Thai-ML was born! Without their perseverance and demonstration of hard-work, I would have never been able to make their dream a reality. Thank you to all who have supported us. It does not go unnoticed.
